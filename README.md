What is the project I made?
I made a game called "Duel Master", which is a 1v1 turn based fight game. The objective is to defeat your opponent by taking their HP down to 0 first.

Why did I make this project?
I enjoy fighting games and I thought this would be a fun idea! Also I knew the level which I can write code and this project would challenge what I know as well as be possible for me to finish in the time duration we had.
